# Shadow Player

Yet another record/play audio app

**What, another one?**

Yes.

**Why not just use an all singing and dancing, much better maintained, infinitely more awesome app like VLC?**

For most media work, you should... however Shadow Player is useful for duetting with yourself.

*	Hit record
*	Play melody one
*	Hit stop
*	Hit play
*	Play melody two whilst shadow player plays melody one

Shadow Player will also accept keyboard short-cuts, notably:

|Key|Function|
|:---:|:---:|
|CTRL 3|record|
|CTRL s|record/play|
|6|play|
|SHIFT g|stop|

Which means you can use any configurable off the shelf Bluetooth pedal page-turner (e.g. [these](https://www.airturn.com/)) with this app - giving you hands free control of your shadow.
